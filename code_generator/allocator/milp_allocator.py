MILP activation allocator
============================================================

Assigns every activation tensor a byte offset in the single SRAM buffer, so
that tensors alive at the same time never share an address and the peak
address touched is minimal. Replaces the greedy FirstFit pass, which reaches
the lower bound on MCUNet-shaped graphs but not on arbitrary ones.

    (x_i - gap_i(1 - r_i)) - x_out_i <= M(1 - d_i)     inplace_tensor_placement_rule

tensor_overlap_fix_rule pins p, q and b on the pairs whose answer is already
known. A candidate's end is one of two layers rather than an unknown, so a pair
evaluated at both tells whether d can change the answer: disjoint even at their
longest, or overlapping even at their shortest, and it is decided. The ends move
by a single layer, so nearly every pair falls one way or the other, and a fixed
binary is substituted out before the solver sees it.

The two no_spatial_overlap_rule rows form a disjunction: whichever way b_t1t2
is set, one binds and the other goes slack, so t1 lies wholly below t2 or wholly
above it. An ILP cannot state "or" directly, hence the binary and the slack
constant.

M has to be as small as it can be while still switching those rows off. The
SRAM limit is the obvious candidate and the wrong one: it is a user setting, so
it can be fifty times any address the model will ever use, and a slack constant
that loose flattens the relaxation until the solver starts returning solutions
well off the optimum and reporting lower == upper on them, which reads as proof.

Whether two tensors are alive together is itself a decision, because a candidate
dies where its output begins only if that aliasing happens. So e_t is a variable,
p_t1t2 records the overlap, and p_t1t2 + q_t1t2 <= 1 turns it into the rule that
matters: never alive together and sharing an address. The two are opposites --
tensors that never coexist are precisely the ones that may reuse each other's
bytes, which is the whole of what the allocator is looking for. Rectangles are
registered in layer order, so tensors_combination is ordered by start too, and
no_temporal_overlap_rule needs only one row -- with start_t1 < start_t2, "t2 ends
before t1 starts" is impossible, and the test reduces to whether t1 is still
alive at start_t2. Layer 0 is the one place two tensors share a start, and there
neither direction can be ruled out.

Touching lifetimes leave the input dead at the very layer its buffer is being
read, which looks like a hole and is not one. Anything live at that layer either
started there, and the only tensor an op produces is the output itself, or
started earlier -- in which case it was live one layer before too, alongside the
input, and no_spatial_overlap_rule already holds it clear of the whole workspace.
The protection is written a layer early, not missing.

Which input an op overwrites is itself a decision. Most ops have one candidate,
but an Add reads both operands at an index before writing that index, so either
will do -- and the choice sets the peak, because a residual block that keeps its
result in the freshly written buffer leaves the older one free and settles one
slot higher than the block before it. Picking it here rather than by a rule
means it is solved for, not guessed.

The d_i sum is at most 1, not exactly 1, so the op may also decline and take a
buffer of its own. That is only safe because e_i grew a decision of its own: a
declined pair keeps the input alive through the layer, p_t1t2 sees the two
overlapping, and no_spatial_overlap_rule holds them apart. With a fixed lifetime
the same freedom would let a kernel overwrite its own input while still reading it.

How the pair is separated is the second decision. The output must start gap_i
below where the input is read from, and there are two ways to arrange that:
memmove the input up by gap_i and write the output from x_i (r_i = 1), or leave
the input alone and start the output at x_i - gap_i (r_i = 0). Both give the
kernel the same geometry -- and it needs no telling which, since it shifts only
when handed one pointer for both. The first costs a copy, the second costs the
freedom to place the output. So r_i is priced into the objective at C per byte
moved, and the solver pays for a memmove only where placing the output low would
cost more peak than the copy is worth.

z_i carries gap_i only when r_i does, since an unshifted input occupies just its
own bytes; r_i <= d_i keeps a candidate that is not the one being overwritten
from claiming either. Both rows would be products of two decisions written the
obvious way -- x_i d_i to select an address, gap_i d_i r_i to size the workspace
-- so each is a big-M pair or an implication instead. An integer program is
linear.

Both freedoms can be taken away, to measure what they are worth or to fall back
on the older behaviour. optimize_right_shift=False adds
inplace_tensor_always_right_shift_rule, pinning one shift per output so every
pair is separated by a memmove as it was before r_i existed.
optimize_inplace_flexible=False adds not_inplace_flexible_rule, pinning each
candidate's lifetime to the aliased one so no op may decline its buffer.
